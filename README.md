## Project Description

This site can be used to get the information including price, supply and trading information for any Cryptocurrency. I build this site while studying for my AWS Developer Associate exam to become more comfortable with the AWS ecosystem. It uses a [cryptocurrency API](min-api.cryptocompare.com) to retrieve price information and the latest news about currencies.

The app allows you to search the cryptocurrency ticket, e.g. BTC, ETH, LTC in the URL to retrieve information about a particular currency. I would prefer to update this to be a query string and to use a search box on the home page. This should be done soon.

### [](https://github.com/timrooke1991/Crypto-Serverless-Project#challenges-faced)What I learned

I build this site while studying for my AWS Developer Associate exam to become more comfortable with the AWS ecosystem. It taught me a lot about how AWS resources work together. This was my first 'serverless' projects. Experimenting with Functions as a Service was interesting. It required me think more about what my specific functions were doing.

Improvements that I would like to make to the project in the future would be:

- Update the search for currencies to be a query string
- Style the home page properly with a nav bar and perhaps the highest volume currencies for that day
